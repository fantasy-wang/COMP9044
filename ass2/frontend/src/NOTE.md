The `src` directory should hold all your javascript application code.

Mostly we're happy for you to implement the assignment 
however you so choose. That said for your assignment to 
be able to be run by our autotests it must use -

1. ES modules to organise your code (we've covered these in previous lectures, but for more info check out [this resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import))

2. The entrypoint of your app needs to be called `main.js` and this file needs to export a function that takes a single argument, the url of the app. This will allow us to run your
app seperately the the demos.

We've provided these files for you to make it easy.s
